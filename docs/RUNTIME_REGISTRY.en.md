# Runtime Registry

This document records the runtime dependencies for Amneziya, where they live in the repository, and how to verify a VPS before another production test.

## Stored In Git

The repository stores lightweight, auditable artifacts only:

- `deploy/runtime/manifest.yml` - runtime requirement manifest;
- `deploy/runtime/check_vps.sh` - read-only VPS checker;
- `deploy/runtime/collect_debug_snapshot.sh` - read-only debug snapshot collector;
- `deploy/examples/servers.host_systemd.example.yml` - host/systemd server config example;
- `deploy/examples/servers.docker.example.yml` - Docker server config example;
- `deploy/examples/.env.production.example` - production `.env` template without real secrets;
- `deploy/examples/nginx-proxy-manager-notes.ru.md` - reverse proxy notes for the web panel.

## SSH Auth

Recommended mode for live health checks and future apply/revoke operations is SSH key auth:

```yaml
ssh:
  auth:
    type: key
    private_key_path: /root/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Password auth is also supported, but it requires `sshpass` on the server running the bot/web panel:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y sshpass
```

In `servers.yml`:

```yaml
ssh:
  auth:
    type: password
```

In `.env`:

```env
VPS_SSH_PASSWORD=CHANGE_ME_REAL_SSH_PASSWORD
```

The password is passed to `sshpass` through `SSHPASS`, not through command-line arguments. If `VPS_SSH_PASSWORD` is not set or `sshpass` is missing, live health checks fail with an explicit local error before remote commands run.

## Not Stored In Git

Do not store real `.env`, `servers.yml`, SSH private keys, bot tokens, `APP_SECRET_KEY`, SQLite databases, backup archives, generated client configs, QR images, Docker images, virtual environments, `node_modules`, or logs with private data.

### Secret-bearing delivery artifacts

`.conf`, QR payload/PNG, and `vpn://` import links are `client-config-secret` artifacts.
They must not be included in runtime diagnostics, plain backups, audit metadata, logs, or error output.
If such an artifact reaches text diagnostic output, it must pass through `app.security.redaction.redact()`.

If heavy artifacts are needed later, put them in GitHub Releases or separate storage. Keep only URL, version, and checksum in the repository.

## Quick VPS Check

Docker peer apply/revoke requires `runtime.config_path` in `servers.yml`. The app rewrites that persistent config inside the container and then runs `docker restart <container_name>`. Traffic collection and `sync-peers` are read-only and use `awg show <interface> dump`.

Host/systemd runtime:

```bash
cd /opt/amn2
bash deploy/runtime/check_vps.sh
```

Docker runtime:

```bash
cd /opt/amn2
AMN_RUNTIME=docker AMN_CONTAINER_NAME=amnezia-awg AMN_INTERFACE=awg0 bash deploy/runtime/check_vps.sh
```

## First `RemoteOperationRunner` Slice

Server health checks use the first `RemoteOperationRunner` slice:

- risk class: `read-only-remote`;
- command policy: existing read-only allowlist;
- remote side effects: none;
- local side effects: health snapshot and admin audit event when launched from web;
- consistency status: `read-only`.

This slice does not enable peer apply/revoke, Docker config writes, firewall changes, or destructive operations.

The script does not install packages, change firewall rules, restart services, or write files. It only reads VPS state and exits with code `1` when critical errors are found.

## Debug Snapshot

When a full VPS report is needed:

```bash
cd /opt/amn2
bash deploy/runtime/collect_debug_snapshot.sh
```

For Docker runtime:

```bash
cd /opt/amn2
AMN_RUNTIME=docker AMN_CONTAINER_NAME=amnezia-awg AMN_INTERFACE=awg0 bash deploy/runtime/collect_debug_snapshot.sh
```

The detailed command list and redaction rules are documented in `docs/VPS_LOG_COLLECTION.ru.md`.
